I've used CSS for a looooong time and I never knew that the `>` angle bracket combinator, what I called the direct child selector, was called a COMBINATOR. But it sounds aggro, like a '90s **Front Line Assembly** album.

     ____  ____      _    _____ _____ 
    |  _ \|  _ \    / \  |  ___|_   _|
    | | | | |_) |  / _ \ | |_    | |
    | |_| |  _ <  / ___ \|  _|   | |
    |____/|_| \_\/_/   \_\_|     |_|
                                      
There are four types of combinators:

1. All Following Sibling selector (~)
2. Immediate Adjacent, Following Sibling selector (+)
3. Child selector (>)
4. Descendant selector (space)

insane lol
