I've used CSS for a looooong time and I never knew that the `>` angle bracket combinator, what I called the direct child selector, was called a COMBINATOR. But it sounds aggro, like a '90s **Front Line Assembly** album.

There are four types of combinators, and their actual names are not great, so I've renamed them:

1. All Following Sibling selector (~)
2. Immediate Adjacent, Following Sibling selector (+)
3. Child selector (>)
4. Descendant selector (space)

{{< codepen id="zVXeKd" tab="result" >}}

<!-- Doesn't demonstrate ~ yet but i have to go now lol -->
