I've used CSS for a little while now but until recently I didn't know
that the formal name for inter-selector operators like the direct child
`>` angle bracket, is a COMBINATOR. _It sounds intense, like a '90s
**Front Line Assembly** album._

There are four types of combinators, and you can think of them this way:

1. The Descendant selector (space)
2. the Selector List
3. The Direct Child selector (>)
4. The Immediate, Subsequent Sibling selector (+)
5. The Subsequent Siblings selector (~)
