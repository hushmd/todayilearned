The "Em" as a unit of size in CSS text and boxes comes from an old
typoegraphic unit from the print days: the "em", which was the width of
a capital letter M in a given type face. (This is no longer true — in
the modern era of computers and CSS, an em simply means "the font size
number in px".

Wikipedia:


> In modern typefaces, the character M is usually somewhat less than one
em wide. Moreover, as type includes a wider variety of languages and
character sets without M's, and needs a consistent way to refer to size,
its meaning has evolved to simply mean the px / point size of the
typeface.

Mutton-quads!

> One em was traditionally defined as the width of the capital M in the
current typeface and point size,[2] because the M was commonly cast the
full-width of the square blocks, or em-quads (also mutton-quads), which
are used in printing presses.
