See each of these menu navigation patterns [demonstrated in practice][link].

### Do Nothing Approach
This involves just adding a little padding to your links to optimize them for touch enabled devices.

### Footer Navigation
A link in your header will take the user to your navigation list in the footer of your site.

### Select Menu
This technique takes your menu list and turns them into a <select> element through the power of JavaScript.

### Menu Overlay
This simple technique turns your menu into a simple one column overlay drop-down.

### Multi Toggle
This technique turns your menu into an accordion style list. Great for large menus and very versatile.

### Off Canvas
Hide your navigation "off canvas" and reveal it when your menu toggle button is clicked. Popularized by Facebook.

### Grid Based
This is a really nice way to present your menu at the top or bottom of your page. Just a clean grid based method.

### The Flip Method
This is a "neat" way to hide your nav, but maybe only good for vanity's sake right now.

### Always Off Canvas
This is a very cool way to use off canvas all the time + it's touch enabled!
