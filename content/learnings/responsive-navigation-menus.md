Someone has made a taxonomy of approaches for handling navigation menus
broadly in responsive (mobile + desktop) web apps. See them
[demonstrated in practice][link].

1. "Do Nothing" Approach
2. Anchor-to-Footer - food
3. Menu Overlay - good
4. Multi Toggle (accordion-style list) - bad
5. Off-Canvas slide - good, popularized by Facebook.
6. Always Off Canvas  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
