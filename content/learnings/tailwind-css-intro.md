[Tailwind CSS][why] is an opinionated\* CSS framework, which means it's
not just a pile of semantic, conceptual classes. It makes some atomic
(small) design decisions for you, and nudges the page author in a
direction towards hopefully good-looking components and pages.

_\* Like [Ruby on Rails][rails], which coined the popular label "opinionated" for
frameworks_

Tailwind describes itself in a surprising way:

> Tailwind is more than a CSS framework, it's an engine for creating
design systems.

Adam W has a great video course introducing Tailwind CSS with a deep-dive
through creating a sample project. I'm progressing through it now. Check
out [the beautiful screencasts section of the Tailwind CSS site][tailwind-course] 
(actually all his stuff looks great, he clearly puts a lot of work into it).
