There are many formats to represent color values in code or numbers:
RGB, Hex (hexadecimal RGB triplets), named colors, etc. Each has its merits.
Hex, for example, is a quick format for pasting between Photoshop,
Sketch, and CSS code.

But HSL is the best for a pure CSS approach to representing colors.
Manipulating color values in the way that developers and designers want
to, e.g make this color a little bit duller, or make this 10% brighter,
is easy and intuitive.

<!-- Andrew Heaton convo -->

* Hex colors are for boneheads
* Can’t sight read 90% of the colors
* Can’t adjust the colors in any logical way
