It turns out that SVG art scales differently depending on whether itâ€™s
inline in the page, or referenced externally as a file...! Why this
should is makes no sense to me, but here's a simple way to scale SVG
correctly, proportionately, using just CSS:

In brief:

1. I define a priori the **target width** and **actual** ratio of the existing art using [CSS][css] [variables][vars]
2. Use CSS3's `calc()` function with the `width` and `ratio` vars to simply calculate the proportional target **height**
3. Now just set `.your_svg { width: var(--width); height: var(--height); `

Hover over the SVG art below, then click the SCSS and JS tabs to see how
it works.
