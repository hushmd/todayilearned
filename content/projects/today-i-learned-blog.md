Admitting you don't know everything is frightening, but it's the
foundational step of learning. I don't know everything about web
development. I used to know just about every aspect of scalable front-
and back-end web development practices, but ten years growing and
managing a team at Zivity and Plus One and 140 Proof has meant that my
Javascript and front-end hacking skills have not kept pace with the
modern landscape[1].

The web development world has also fractured, to the point that a
diagram like this ostensibly makes sense to many people:

{{< img src="/art/front-end-dev-roadmap-diagram" type="png"
  caption="front-end web development diagram" >}}

To keep my skills sharp and have fun, I'm diving back into the maze of
front-end web development, and cataloging my daily learnings on this blog.

I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the static
site generator after considering [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) because Jekyll seems slow, outdated,
and less deeply considered than Hugo. Gatsby might be reasonable if you
need everything to be fairly complicated React app and think seventeen
layers of Javascript is a normal, healthy state of affairs.

## 76 posts, 5 projects, 258 git commits, and counting

I regret nothing.

[1] Oh, and landscape is the wrong metaphor, because a landscape changes in
[geologic time][geotime]. The web development frontier changes in highly
accelerated real time. There are dozens of new techniques and
frameworks, hundreds of new CSS properties and Javascript functions, and
thousands of new NPM packages that are now key parts of modern web
development that I've never touched.
